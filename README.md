# Manual-Testing-Project-on-OpenCart
This repository contains a manual testing project based on the OpenCart platform. I tested core features like login, search, cart, and checkout, then documented test cases, execution results, bugs, and RTM. It was created to practice real-world manual testing and improve my QA skills. 🧪🐞
