## 🧪 Manual Testing Project on OpenCart

This repository showcases my manual testing practice project based on the **[OpenCart](https://www.opencart.com/)** platform – a popular open-source eCommerce solution. This project is designed to demonstrate my knowledge and hands-on skills in software quality assurance (SQA) using manual testing techniques.

### 📂 Project Overview

OpenCart is a widely-used platform that offers various features such as user registration, product management, cart functionality, order processing, and more. The goal of this testing project is to identify functional issues, ensure proper user flow, and verify that the core modules work as intended.

### ✅ Objectives

* Understand the functionality of a live eCommerce platform.
* Apply manual testing methodologies to identify bugs and verify features.
* Practice writing industry-standard test documents.
* Simulate a real-world QA workflow including test execution and bug reporting.
